Airline App Inspired by my university, final application will include functional Client and Server Apps with GUIs


From 4/13/2019

App asks users for basic input and information on their upcoming flight. Hitting the reserve button allows the 
user to see their ticket information printed on the screen.
Users form will go through validation and an AlertBox class allows a separate dialogue box to prompt the user of any errors.

Basic Simple Socket Server Support included as well. (GUI may crash if you dont currently have one of your own. 
Feel free to wait for mine :))






Some of the Java FX GUI controls utilized are Text Fields, a Text Area, 
Radio Buttons, Labels, DatePickers, ComboBoxes and Buttons.
