Airline App Inspired by my university, final application will include functional Client and Server Apps with GUIs

App asks users for basic input and information on their upcoming flight. Hitting the reserve button allows the 
user to see their ticket information printed on the screen.

User validation makes sure the users input is appropriate for the text field.
